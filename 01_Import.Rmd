# Import

This is where you would import all of your data, from every source needed (flat files, excel files, database queries, etc.).

```{r import}
read_ ("Data/Raw/") -> data
```

All data should undergo a cursory check (are the types correctly attributed for example?), and be saved as-is in a flat file format (preferably csv).

```{r export}
data %>%
  write.csv("Data/.csv", row.names = F)
```
