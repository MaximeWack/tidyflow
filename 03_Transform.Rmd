```{r libs}
library(tidyverse)
# library(lubridate)
```

# Transform

First the tidy-ed data are read from the Rds and exposed in the global environment.

```{r import}
readRDS("Data/tidy.rds") %>%
  list2env(envir = globalenv())
```

This is where you would transform your data.  
Destructive transformation are allowed here, feel free to experiment!

```{r transform}
data %>%
  mutate() %>%
  select() %>%
  filter() -> data
```

Data are exported again in Rds, after transformation.

```{r export}
list(data = data) %>%
  saveRDS("Data/transformed.rds")
```
