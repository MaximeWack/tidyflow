```{r libs}
library(tidyverse)
# library(lubridate)
```

# Tidy

First the data are read from the flat file produced in the **Import** step.

```{r import}
read_csv("Data/.csv") -> data
```

This is where you would tidy your data.  
This shouldn't contain destructive transformation of data, just handling of types and obvious errors.

```{r tidy}
data %>%
  select() %>%
  filter() %>%
  mutate() %>%
  mutate_if(is.character, factor) -> data
```

The data are then exported in Rds to keep the formatting.  
You can export as many objects as you want, as long as they are inside a named list.

```{r export}
list(data = data) %>%
  saveRDS(file = "Data/tidy.rds")
```
